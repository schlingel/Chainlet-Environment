/**
 * <p>This is a model class which is used in a client code jar. The RSE interpreter
 * is build upon the principle that the very basics must be enough for the interpreter
 * and everything else - e.g. IFs or LOOPs - are build in client libraries which could
 * be plugged in.</p>
 * <p>Such a plugin is very simple constructed:</p>
 * <pre>
 * + Jar-Root
 * |
 * +- mapping.xml
 * +- class1
 * +- class2
 * +- directory
 *        |
 *        +- class 3
 *        +- class 4
 * ...
 * </pre>
 * <p>The mapping file contains a listing of the classes and the dictionary which contains them. If
 * the JAR-file contains classes which are not mentioned in a dictionary tag, then they are added to the
 * default dictionary. If the mapping doesn't contain a default </p>
