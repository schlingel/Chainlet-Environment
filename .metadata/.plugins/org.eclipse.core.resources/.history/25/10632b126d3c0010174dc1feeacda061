 * <p>This is a model class which is used in a client code jar. The RSE interpreter
 * is build upon the principle that the very basics must be enough for the interpreter
 * and everything else - e.g. IFs or LOOPs - are build in client libraries which could
 * be plugged in.</p>
 * <p>Such a plugin is very simple constructed:</p>
 * <pre>

 * +- class2
 * +- directory
